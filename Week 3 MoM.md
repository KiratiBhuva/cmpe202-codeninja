#Week 3 MoM

What did the team do the past week?
We expanded our product backlog with functionalities. We added more actions the player can do. 

What is the team going to do in the next week?
ART WEEK is pushed for next week. We will find open source images with appropoate licences. We are also going to test a greenfoot program by running it on browser. We are going to figure out ways to add design patters in our application. This is the core requirement of the project and thus needs to be of higer priority.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Lack of practice and experience in design patters has made finding their use cases a little difficult.
