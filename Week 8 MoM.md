#Week 8 Minutes Of Meetings

What did the team do the past week?
We worked on our master stage. We added sound to most of our stages. We implemented our design patterns in our project. We refactored some of the code. We also discarded some of the code which was not working and was a main requirement.

What is the team going to do in the next week?
We are going to make our project reports and will create our UML diagrams and wireframes. We will finish our integration and start with testing of the entire integrates project.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
We weren't able to finish with all the features that we had originally intended. Since, they were not the core requirements, we will not be focusing on them.
