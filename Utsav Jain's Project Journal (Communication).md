I am tasked with promoting the value of robust communication in the project team. For achieving more productive communication, I proposed the use of the popular work space communication app, "Slack". Although, the team has not fully adopted to using it, a good part of the communication still happens on WhattsApp, I am hopeful that as the project progresses, I would be able to convince the team about the merits of using Slack and thus will yield in more productive environment. In group meetings I have advocated for use of the Kanban board for clearly communicating the details of the issues and their description. I make sure that no issue discussed in the meeting was left out of the Kanban board. I understand that transparency is very important of an Agile project to succeed and communication is an important part of it. My target for the next week is to have a daily conversation about the project progress on Slack so that it would become easy to implement Scrum in the second half of the project.
