#Week 1
I am tasked with promoting the value of robust communication in the project team. For achieving more productive communication, I proposed the use of the popular work space communication app, "Slack". Although, the team has not fully adopted to using it, a good part of the communication still happens on WhattsApp, I am hopeful that as the project progresses, I would be able to convince the team about the merits of using Slack and thus will yield in more productive environment. 
In group meetings I have advocated for use of the Kanban board for clearly communicating the details of the issues and their description. I make sure that no issue discussed in the meeting was left out of the Kanban board. I understand that transparency is very important of an Agile project to succeed and communication is an important part of it. 
My target for the next week is to have a daily conversation about the project progress on Slack so that it would become easy to implement Scrum in the second half of the project.

#Week 2
The team's communication was robust. All members were comfortably able to interact with each other regarding their concerns. Slack was used for project communication. The Kanban board was used for this week to clearly communicate the tasks assigned to individuals and all the problems were dealt with. 

#Week 3
This week the communication via GitHub based project Kanban board was plenty sufficient. Everyone was able to decide on the issues and were assigned issues accordingly. The new phase of design patterns is starting in the project. This will also mean more ingeration tasks will come up. I forcast that the task of maintaining good communicaiton lines will increase and I will have to work harder to keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.
