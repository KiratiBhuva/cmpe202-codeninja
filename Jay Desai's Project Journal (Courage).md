I am tasked with promoting the value of Courage in the project team.

What is courage in extreme programming?

Courage highlights the methodologies like ready to change, accepting feedback, have courage to communicate, refactor as much as possible and throw away the existing prototypes 

My responsibilities-

* Make team focus on only what is required.
* To communicate and accept feedback
* Tell the truth about progress and estimates.
* Make team to refactor the code.
* Make team to adapt to changes whenever they happen.

Week-1:

In week1, we had a task of exploring various game engines, exploring different ideas on our project and exploring github activities. So, I made focus areas like github activities, MelonJs, Greenfoot etc. and made team goals focused.
In the weekly meeting, we shared the progress and I gave feedback on the progress.   

Week-2:

* In this week, we bifurcated our project into small modules so we had so many modules to work on. So, I made my team to 
  make a priority list of modules based on the complexity and importance. And at the end of the week we were able to 
  finish all the priority modules. 
*  In first team meeting, we were thinking about developing our game in Melon.Js.But after a week's research work we found 
   that we will get more materials in Greenfoot engine. So, we wanted to finalize our engine to Greenfoot. At first, we 
   were not much confident about the change but I gave courage to accept the change and at last we were able to adept to 
   the new technology.     

Week-3:

* In earlier weeks, we were able to decide the gaming platform and were able to develop sample codes that can be reusable 
  in future. In this week, we had a bigger challenge of choosing either - to go for our main character design or to learn 
  about Design Patterns. As, Design Patterns are integral part of this project, I made my team focus on learning Design 
  patterns. At the end of the week we were able to develop sample codes in Design patterns.

Week-4:

* In this week, we had a challenge to keep up the work going as we had our midterm exams.I made the priority list to be 
  followed and gave courage to work whenever we get time from reading and exams. Also, this was the last week of kanban 
  and we were left with the important issues like individual map designs, identify patterns to be implemented, design 
  our main character, started building individual UML diagrams. So, I have cleared the tasks that are pending and 
  communicated the required efforts. Because of this planning, we were able to work on most of the issues.   

Week-5:

* This was one of the most important week as we are moving from kanban to Scrum. So,to adept the changes and to deliver 
   good work in this week, I had made sure that team is aware of the scrum methodologies, approaches in scrum, difference 
   between kanban and scrum etc. Also, in this week we had decided to get head start in terms of coding exercise so that 
   we can get enough time for extra activities. For that, I made a worksheet so that we can trace our work and complete it in time.   

Week-6:

* In total 6 weeks we have made a good progress in terms of codeing. But, I found one area where my team can improve and that 
  is to refactore the code. So, in this week along with the regular coding I made my team to refactore the code and there by 
  making the code more sustainable in longer run. Also, as we are approching the ending of the project we analyzed each others 
  progress and communicated the feedback on area to improve. 

Week-7:

* Before week 7, we were working on the individual funcationality. But as we are approching the end of the project, we needed to 
  merge our code and change our functionality according to the other member's code/ functionality. So, I gave courage to the other 
  team members to implement these changes and make our game more integrated. Also, we have decided to make one last integrated stage
  on which every one can work. We devided the work that has to be done by individuals. Also, I made a priority list for the last
  stage so that no work will remain pending.    

Week-8:

*  As week 8 was supposed to be the last week, we had so much work to do like integration and refactoring. So to cover all the required
   tasks, I made priority list/ list for the task to be completed. We followed the priority list and were able to complete all the desired
   functionalities. Integration code was the most complex task we faced as integration require code changes to every team member's code.
   For that, I provided the courage to my team members to accept the changes and integrate the code. Also, refactoring the code was a big
   challange, but with good collabration we were able to handle that task easily.
