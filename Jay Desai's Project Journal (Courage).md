I am tasked with promoting the value of Courage in the project team.

What is courage in extreme programming?

Courage highlights the methodologies like ready to change, accepting feedback, have courage to communicate, refactor as much as possible and throw away the existing prototypes 

My responsibilities-

* Make team focus on only what is required.
* To communicate and accept feedback
* Tell the truth about progress and estimates.
* Make team to refactor the code.
* Make team to adapt to changes whenever they happen.

Week-1:

In week1, we had a task of exploring various game engines, exploring different ideas on our project and exploring github activities. So, I made focus areas like github activities, MelonJs, Greenfoot etc. and made team goals focused.
In the weekly meeting, we shared the progress and I gave feedback on the progress.   

Week-2:

* In this week, we bifurcated our project into small modules so we had so many modules to work on. So, I made my team to 
  make a priority list of modules based on the complexity and importance. And at the end of the week we were able to 
  finish all the priority modules. 
*  In first team meeting, we were thinking about developing our game in Melon.Js.But after a week's research work we found 
   that we will get more materials in Greenfoot engine. So, we wanted to finalize our engine to Greenfoot. At first, we 
   were not much confident about the change but I gave courage to accept the change and at last we were able to adept to 
   the new technology.     

Week-3:

* In earlier weeks, we were able to decide the gaming platform and were able to develop sample codes that can be reusable 
  in future. In this week, we had a bigger challenge of choosing either - to go for our main character design or to learn 
  about Design Patterns. As, Design Patterns are integral part of this project, I made my team focus on learning Design 
  patterns. At the end of the week we were able to develop sample codes in Design patterns.

Week-4:

* In this week, we had a challenge to keep up the work going as we had our midterm exams.I made the priority list to be 
  followed and gave courage to work whenever we get time from reading and exams. Also, this was the last week of kanban 
  and we were left with the important issues like individual map designs, identify patterns to be implemented, design 
  our main character, started building individual UML diagrams. So, I have cleared the tasks that are pending and 
  communicated the required efforts. Because of this planning, we were able to work on most of the issues.
