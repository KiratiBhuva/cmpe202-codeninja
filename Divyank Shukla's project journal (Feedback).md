"Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming. Feedback is the treatment." - Kent Beck,creator of extreme programming.

Definition of feedback:- Feedback ensures iteration commitment at all levels so as to check the pace of development, plot progress and enhance team confidence that we are on right track.

My responsibilities are to ensure feedback through:-

System:-Writing test cases which ensures that development is as per expectation.
Team:-In case of new addition of a feature to game, the team will give new estimation of time required to complete.
User:-Since clients suggest development tests to steer the development, I have asked my gaming-freak friends from other department to review and discuss their expectations. So, I will ensure there is continuous feedback to make the game as appealing as possible.

Week 1: Since this is inception of project, we have explored different gaming engines, had ice-breaker sessions to know more about each other and how each one of us can contribute the best and started with our regular github activities. Each one of us has implemented a sample game on the gaming engines and provided their learnings. Here's the link to feedback communications through slack:- https://202-codeninja.slack.com/messages/C74GS5Z9S/

Week 2: In this week, we are now comfortable with discussing our problems and tasks on slack very easily. We have divided the action modules amongst us and put the same on task board. At the end of week , we could finish most of our tasks. Also, initially we decided to develop the game on Melonjs platform but after researching more and based on the feedback I gave to team, the team finally decided to make Greenfoot as our final game development zone.

Week3: This was a tough week in the sense we had to decide between going through project's flow or adapting patterns. Basically, we are following structural approach here so that we do not have to change later. We are learning and incorporating design patterns in our code. Based on previous feedback of our coding experience in GreenFoot, I felt we could make code more organised by keeping it organised through pattern. The change was phenomenal for us and we could see how patterns can help make our coding clean, organised and easy to maintain.
