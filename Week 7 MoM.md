#Week 7 Minutes Of Meetings

What did the team do the past week?
We started creating our boss fight scenario. The boss or master or monster will be an oscilitating character throwing wepons at out character and the character will have to dodge the attacks and at the same time will have to return fire at the antagonist. We implemented the builder pattern for the boss to shoot weapons at the player.

What is the team going to do in the next week?
We are going to make our boss fight scene for all the worlds. We will integerate our worlds and create the final project. We will give final touches to our code, like adding comments creating out respective diagrams. We will also go through all the requirements of our project to look and find whether we missed something or not.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Since this is the final week we are going to prepare all the documentation and be ready with the final release.
