#Week 4 MoM

What did the team do the past week?
We started to create more functionalties. We explored which and where design patterns could be used in our game. We also did a review of the basic functionalities of the game.

What is the team going to do in the next week?
In the next week we are going to create worlds. Our main character is to fight in four different worlds, viz, Earth, Fire, Air and Water. We will design these worlds and create playable games for each individial world. Each inividial member of the team has been assigned a world to develop. We will also be integrating design patters in our game since that is our core requirement.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Finding art for the project has been a little difficult. The images should be open source and free to use. Finding such images has been a little difficult for our particular scenario. We will continue to look for them as we develop our applicaiton.
