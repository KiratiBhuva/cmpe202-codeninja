What did the team do the past week?
We created our respective worlds.
We implemented out respective design patterns.

What is the team going to do in the next week?
We will further enhance our worlds by adding more features.
We will look for art that can be used in our project.
We will follow scrum in the next week more relogiously.  

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Scrum is a new more rigid methodoly. Adapting to it has been a little stressful. Finding open source art is a little hard. Running an applet on the browser is still not achieved.
