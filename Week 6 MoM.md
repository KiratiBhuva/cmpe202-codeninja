#Week 5 MoM

What did the team do the past week?
In the last week we improved our respective levels (worlds). We implemented barriers in our respective worlds. We also looked for images that could be used for our respective worlds. Sound was also integrated to some of the worlds.

What is the team going to do in the next week?
We are going to refactor our code. We are also going to all sound to all of our worlds. We will merge atleast two worlds together to test integration and identify integration issues. We will also be creating one boss fighting scenario.

What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Out most difficult blocker was to run the game on Google Chrome but now, since the professor has removed that as a requirement we might not do it.
